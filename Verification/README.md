# Verification of Optical Modeling on Sunshape and Surface Slope Error

The verification involves six optical modelling tools in CSP, including: SolTrace, Tonatiuh, Tracer, Heliosim, Solstice and SolarPILOT. Three rounds of tests were progressed to compare and verify the results from these six tools.
